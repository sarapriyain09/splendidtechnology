## Typical UK Shopify costs (realistic ranges)

Shopify build costs depend mainly on design complexity, catalogue size, and integrations.

| Build type | Typical UK cost range | Typical timeline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Starter Shopify setup (theme + basic pages) | £1,500–£4,000 | 1–3 weeks |
| Customised theme + strong UX (most SMEs) | £4,000–£12,000 | 3–8 weeks |
| Advanced Shopify build (complex catalogue + integrations) | £10,000–£30,000+ | 6–12+ weeks |
| Headless Shopify (custom frontend) | £20,000–£80,000+ | 10–20+ weeks |

These figures are for professional builds with performance, analytics basics, and a clean handover.

## What drives Shopify project cost

### 1) Theme: off-the-shelf vs custom

- An off-the-shelf theme can be great if you keep changes minimal.
- A custom theme makes sense when you need unique layouts, strong conversion UX, or a brand-led experience.

### 2) Catalogue complexity

The time sink is often product data:

- variants (size/colour)
- collections
- filtering requirements
- product content consistency

### 3) Apps and integrations

Apps are helpful, but:

- too many apps = slow site
- overlapping apps = conflicts
- “script-heavy” apps = poor Core Web Vitals

Integrations that add scope:

- email marketing flows
- accounting (Xero/QuickBooks)
- subscriptions
- ERP/warehouse syncing

### 4) Tracking and attribution

If you run paid ads, tracking matters.

A solid setup includes:

- analytics
- conversion events
- cookie consent where appropriate

---

## Timelines by complexity (what’s realistic)

A common UK pattern:

- **Week 1–2:** discovery, sitemap, key templates, theme selection
- **Week 2–4:** build core pages (home, collection, product, cart)
- **Week 3–6:** data import, shipping/payments, email templates
- **Week 4–8:** QA, performance, tracking, launch prep

The fastest way to delay a Shopify project is missing content and product data.

## Common pitfalls (and how to avoid them)

### Pitfall 1: App bloat

If every feature is an app:

- the site slows down
- checkout UX becomes inconsistent
- you pay recurring monthly fees forever

Better approach:

- pick only the apps you truly need
- prefer lightweight apps
- build small custom features when it’s cheaper long-term

### Pitfall 2: Slow theme performance

Store speed affects conversion and SEO.

Avoid:

- massive image files
- unnecessary scripts
- too many trackers

### Pitfall 3: “Custom everything” with no strategy

Not every page needs a unique layout.

A strong Shopify store usually relies on:

- repeatable sections
- consistent template patterns
- simple editorial control for the team

### Pitfall 4: Poor product page UX

Product pages are where you earn the sale.

Make sure you include:

- clear benefits
- shipping/returns information near the CTA
- trust signals (reviews, guarantees)
- clear variant selection

### Pitfall 5: No plan for ongoing improvements

Successful stores iterate.

Plan for:

- seasonal updates
- landing pages for campaigns
- CRO experiments (A/B tests)

## When headless Shopify makes sense

Headless Shopify can be excellent, but it’s not a default.

Consider headless if:

- performance is critical and you need a highly custom UX
- you have complex content needs beyond standard themes
- you need a frontend that behaves more like a product than a store

If your needs are straightforward, a well-built theme will usually deliver better ROI.

## Next step: get a Shopify scope and timeline

If you tell us:

- number of products and variants
- shipping rules (UK/international)
- must-have apps/integrations
- examples of stores you like

…we’ll recommend the simplest approach and provide a realistic timeline.
