## Autonomous Scheduler (Cron or n8n)

The weekly campaign playbook can run independently of dashboard visits via a secured automation endpoint.

### Option A: Cron on Raspberry Pi

Use the helper script:

```bash
scripts/trigger-weekly-playbook.sh
```

Example cron (every Monday at 07:00):

```bash
0 7 * * 1 APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3002 AUTOMATION_API_KEY=your_strong_random_secret /home/sarapriyain/Projects/CRM/splendid_CRM_git/scripts/trigger-weekly-playbook.sh >> /home/sarapriyain/weekly-playbook.log 2>&1
```

Morning brief email (Mon-Fri at 07:15):

```bash
15 7 * * 1-5 APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3002 AUTOMATION_API_KEY=your_strong_random_secret /home/sarapriyain/Projects/CRM/splendid_CRM_git/scripts/trigger-morning-brief-email.sh >> /home/sarapriyain/morning-brief-email.log 2>&1
```

LinkedIn campaign queue build (Mon-Fri at 06:45, 150 target companies):

```bash
45 6 * * 1-5 APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3002 AUTOMATION_API_KEY=your_strong_random_secret TARGET_COUNT=150 /home/sarapriyain/Projects/CRM/splendid_CRM_git/scripts/trigger-linkedin-campaign.sh >> /home/sarapriyain/linkedin-campaign.log 2>&1
```

Facebook web campaign queue build (one-shot or periodic refresh):

```bash
APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3002 AUTOMATION_API_KEY=your_strong_random_secret DURATION_DAYS=90 /home/sarapriyain/Projects/CRM/splendid_CRM_git/scripts/trigger-facebook-web-campaign.sh
```

Note: personal-profile LinkedIn connection requests/messages are not sent by API here; this automation prepares targets and follow-up workflow in CRM for compliant manual sending.

### Option B: n8n

1. Add a Cron node (weekly, Monday, 07:00).
2. Add HTTP Request node:
	- Method: POST
	- URL: `https://your-domain/api/automation/weekly-playbook`
	- Header: `x-automation-key: <AUTOMATION_API_KEY>`
	- Body JSON: `{ "force": false }`

The endpoint is idempotent per week, so repeated triggers will not duplicate weekly tasks.

## Deployment

Primary deployment target is Raspberry Pi 5 with PM2.

The full CRM software is implemented and running on Raspberry Pi 5 infrastructure, and Cloudflare is used to route public web traffic to the CRM services.

- Live CRM process: `splendid-crm`
- Demo CRM process: `splendid-crm-demo`

Current active runtime paths can differ between environments. Validate with:

```bash
pm2 describe splendid-crm
pm2 describe splendid-crm-demo
```

Typical operations:

```bash
git pull origin main
npm run build
pm2 restart splendid-crm
pm2 restart splendid-crm-demo
pm2 status
```

## Security and Compliance Notes

- Keep credentials only in environment files, never in source.
- Use selective import for external lead sources (LinkedIn/Upwork).
- Avoid scraping approaches that violate platform terms.

## Roadmap Candidates

## AI Business Development Department Blueprint

The goal is to run 70-90% of routine BD work through automation while keeping human control for strategy, qualification nuance, and closing.

### Operating model

Treat AI as a team of agents, not one feature:

- Research Assistant: discovers companies and contacts
- SDR Assistant: runs outreach sequences and follow-up logic
- CRM Administrator: updates statuses, activities, and reminders
- Content Writer: drafts social/email content
- Proposal Writer: drafts scope, pricing, and proposal packs
- Human owner: handles negotiation and closing

### What can be automated now

- Prospect research and enrichment: yes
- Decision-maker discovery: yes, with external data sources
- Personalized outreach drafts: yes
- Follow-up reminders and task creation: yes
- Lead scoring and prioritization: yes
- CRM updates and dashboarding: yes
- Meeting scheduling handoff: yes
- Negotiation: partial
- Final close: human-led

### Target outreach workflow

```text
Lead
-> Contacted
-> Connected
-> Replied
-> Qualified
-> Meeting Booked
```

- AI content generation via `/api/ai/bd-generate`
- Task scheduling via `/api/tasks`
- Outreach delivery helpers via `/api/prospects/send-email`, `/api/prospects/bulk-outreach`

Implementation mapping:

- Content queue via `/api/content-posts`
- AI drafting via `/api/ai/bd-generate`
- Weekly planning via `/api/campaigns/playbook`

### 4) CRM Agent (morning summary)

Objective:

- Generate a daily operator brief:
	- new leads found
	- contacts attempted
	- replies received
	- meetings booked
	- follow-ups due today

Implementation mapping:

- Daily summary endpoint: `/api/morning-brief`
- Scheduled email brief: `/api/automation/morning-brief-email`
- KPI rollups: `/api/analytics`, `/api/stats`

### 5) Proposal Agent

Objective:

- Prepare proposal draft, scope, cost estimate, and meeting recap when lead is qualified

Implementation mapping:

- AI draft generation via `/api/ai/bd-generate`
- Quote objects via `/api/quotes`
- Lead/Task linkage via `/api/leads`, `/api/tasks`

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1 (next 30 days)

Ship these as production-grade workflows:

1. Contacts module hardening and enrichment automation
2. Companies module pipeline for source -> enrichment -> qualification
3. Pipeline stage rigor and activity logging
4. AI email generator templates per vertical
5. LinkedIn post generator with weekly queue

Acceptance metrics:

- 20+ fresh prospects/day available in queue
- 100% follow-ups have a task owner and due date
- Time-to-first-outreach under 24h for new qualified records

### Phase 2

Add operational agents:

- Research Agent
- Follow-up Agent
- Proposal Agent

Acceptance metrics:

- 70%+ routine CRM updates fully automated
- 30-50% reduction in manual admin time
- measurable uplift in reply and meeting-booked rates

### Phase 3

Run autonomous morning operation:

Expected daily output:

"Here are 20 new prospects, 6 follow-ups due, 3 replies received, and 1 proposal ready to send."

Production model:

- Scheduler: cron or n8n
- Orchestration endpoints: `/api/automation/*`
- Human in loop for negotiation and close

### Cost model reference

- UK Business Development Manager: approximately GBP 3,000-5,000 per month
- AI/API stack: approximately GBP 50-200 per month
- Optional VA support: approximately GBP 300-500 per month

This supports a lean, scalable GTM system where AI performs repeatable process work and leadership focuses on high-leverage conversations.

## Additional Roadmap Candidates

- Upwork one-click proposal drafting from job URL context
- Communication timeline unification across channels
- Template version history and rollback
- Enhanced conversion analytics by source/vertical/stage
