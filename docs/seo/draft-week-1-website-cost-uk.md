## Quick answer: typical UK website price ranges

Website pricing varies by scope, content, integrations, and how custom the design and build needs to be. As a rule of thumb, UK builds usually land in one of these bands:

| Website type | Typical UK price range (2026) | Typical timeline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Starter brochure site (3–5 pages) | £500–£2,000 | 1–3 weeks |
| Small business site (5–12 pages + lead capture) | £1,500–£6,000 | 2–6 weeks |
| Ecommerce website | £3,000–£20,000+ | 3–10+ weeks |
| Custom web app (accounts, dashboards, workflows) | £8,000–£60,000+ | 6–16+ weeks |

These ranges assume a professional build (proper performance, mobile design, analytics, security basics, and a clean handover). If you’re comparing quotes, always ask what’s included in:

- design and content
- SEO setup
- hosting and maintenance
- integrations (payments, CRM, email marketing)

## What drives cost (and what doesn’t)

### 1) Design: template vs custom UX

- **Template-based** sites are often quicker and cheaper, especially for straightforward service businesses.
- **Custom design** makes sense when conversion matters (e.g., high-value leads), your offer is complex, or you need a unique brand presence.

What increases cost here is not “prettiness”, but the number of unique layouts and the amount of iteration.

### 2) Content: writing and images are real budget items

Many projects underestimate content. If you need:

- service pages written from scratch
- case studies created
- professional photography or custom graphics

…your budget should reflect it. Content is what your customers read and what Google indexes.

### 3) Features and integrations

The cost jump usually comes from features that require data, logic, or third-party services:

- forms that sync to a CRM
- booking systems
- payment processing (Stripe/PayPal)
- customer accounts and permissions
- email automations
- analytics + conversion tracking

Even “simple” integrations can take time because they need testing and edge-case handling.

### 4) Ecommerce complexity (the biggest variable)

Ecommerce pricing depends on:

- number of products and variants
- shipping rules (UK/international)
- promotions, bundles, subscriptions
- inventory, returns, and fulfilment workflow
- integrations (accounting, email, marketplaces)

A clean Shopify build can be excellent value for many businesses. A bespoke ecommerce build becomes worthwhile when you need custom logic or unique user journeys.

### 5) SEO setup (often forgotten)

A good baseline includes:

- clean page titles and meta descriptions
- proper headings (H1/H2)
- sitemap/robots
- fast performance and mobile UX
- internal linking strategy

If you’re serious about enquiries, SEO is not an “extra”—it’s part of making the website work.

### 6) What *doesn’t* usually add much cost

- adding a couple of static pages
- changing colours and typography
- swapping images

Most cost comes from custom logic and integrations, not from basic content updates.

## Timeline vs price: what you get in 2, 4, and 8+ weeks

### A 2-week timeline often means

- using an established layout system
- limited pages (or pages built from provided content)
- one feedback round
- minimal integrations

### A 4–6 week timeline often means

- stronger UX and messaging
- more pages and better structure
- basic automation (forms → email/CRM)
- more QA and polish

### An 8–12+ week timeline often means

- ecommerce or web app functionality
- multiple user roles and admin tools
- advanced integrations
- more stakeholder reviews and iterations

If your deadline is tight, the best way to hit it is usually **phasing**: launch a strong v1, then add features in planned sprints.

## How to get an accurate quote in 15 minutes

A good quote needs clarity. If you can answer these, you’ll get far more accurate pricing:

1) **Goal:** what should the website achieve?
- enquiries?
- bookings?
- ecommerce sales?
- customer onboarding?

2) **Audience:** who is it for?
- UK-wide? Leicester/local? a niche industry?

3) **Pages/features:** what’s essential for v1?
- number of pages
- forms and lead capture
- blog/news
- ecommerce catalogue and checkout
- accounts (login) and dashboards

4) **Integrations:** what must connect?
- CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.)
- email marketing
- payments
- analytics

5) **Examples:** share 2–3 websites you like

6) **Constraints:** timeline, budget range, and who provides content

## Common UK cost mistakes (and how to avoid them)

### Mistake 1: Paying for features you don’t need yet

Start with what proves value. Many websites can launch with:

- clear service pages
- strong CTA
- a lead form
- analytics

Then add extras once you see what users do.

### Mistake 2: “Unlimited revisions” without a scope

It sounds helpful, but unlimited revisions often means slow delivery and unclear responsibility. A better approach is:

- a fixed scope
- structured feedback rounds
- a clear acceptance checklist

### Mistake 3: No plan for maintenance

Websites are software. Budget for at least:

- security updates
- backups
- small content edits
- performance checks

### Mistake 4: Ignoring conversion and tracking

A site can look great and still underperform if you don’t measure:

- which pages drive enquiries
- what users click
- where users drop off

Even lightweight tracking helps you improve the site over time.

## FAQ

### How long does it take to build a website in the UK?
Typically 1–3 weeks for a small brochure site, 2–6 weeks for a small business site, and 6–16+ weeks for ecommerce or custom web apps. Timelines vary by content readiness and integrations.

### What’s the difference between a website and a web app (cost-wise)?
Web apps usually cost more because they involve accounts, data storage, permissions, dashboards, and more testing. If you only need marketing pages and lead capture, a website is usually enough.

### Is Shopify cheaper than a custom ecommerce website?
Often, yes—Shopify can reduce build and maintenance effort for standard ecommerce needs. Custom ecommerce becomes worthwhile when you need unique workflows or complex logic.

### Should I budget for ongoing maintenance?
Yes. Even a simple site benefits from updates, backups, monitoring, and periodic improvements.
